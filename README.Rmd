# Bayesian Latent Severity LCA

A **Bayesian latent class model with continuous severity** for diagnostic test evaluation.

This project extends classical Huiâ€“Walter and random-effects LCA frameworks by introducing a continuous *latent severity* parameter \(S_i\).  
The approach enables efficient estimation of diagnostic accuracies and prevalence using **fewer than four assays**, addressing common identifiability limitations in small-panel diagnostic evaluations.
