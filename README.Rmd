title: "Bayesian Latent Severity LCA"
output: github_document
---

A **Bayesian latent class model with continuous severity** for diagnostic test evaluation.

This project extends classical Hui–Walter and random-effects LCA frameworks by introducing a continuous *latent severity* parameter \(S_i\).  
The approach enables efficient estimation of diagnostic accuracies and prevalence using **fewer than four assays**, addressing common identifiability limitations in small-panel diagnostic evaluations.

## Overview

Traditional latent class models assume conditional independence between binary tests given a latent disease status.  
The **Latent Severity LCA (S-LCA)** relaxes this by allowing within-class variability in disease expression:

\[
T_{ij}^* = \beta_j S_i + \gamma_j + \varepsilon_{ij}, 
\qquad T_{ij} = \mathbb{I}(T_{ij}^* > 0)
\]

Here, \(S_i\) captures the strength or intensity of infection for diseased subjects (\(D_i = 1\)), producing more realistic inference on test sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.
