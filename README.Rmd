# Latent Severity LCA

A **Bayesian latent class model with continuous severity** for diagnostic test evaluation.

This project introduces a *latent severity* parameter \( S_i \) to extend classical Huiâ€“Walter and random-effects latent class models. The approach allows efficient estimation of diagnostic accuracies and prevalence with **fewer than four assays**, addressing identifiability challenges in small-panel diagnostic evaluations.
